# Contributing

Hi, do you want to contribute on this new-born project. Then you are welcome.
I am testing the strength of open-source, do it has some power to gather people around, so lets check it.
Hope we will be friends and do great code and learn alot. So really want to contribute, then follow these things:
* I am not giving any strict instructions, just make a PR which you like to have in this project, you may have read the README file, so you know whats the project. Make a PR will have a discussion about it.
* Want something good, but don't know coding or don't want to code now. No worries, you will learn just make an issue. You will learn alot there.
